## Authentication

The application uses Supabase for authentication. See [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) for detailed instructions on setting up authentication.

To complete the authentication setup:

1. Create a Supabase project at [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Add your Supabase URL and anon key to a `.env` file
3. Configure authentication providers (Email, Google, Facebook) in the Supabase dashboard
4. Set up proper redirect URLs in the Supabase dashboard
